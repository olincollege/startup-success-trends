    "The industry of mobile apps is prominent and rapidly growing. With $133 billion generated across iOS and Andoid apps in 2021 - a 19% increase from 2020 (https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/) - it is worthwhile for investors to take part in this industry. More interesting, however, are possible revenue trends and patterns among mobile app companies. Identifying these patterns makes investment choices easier (especially when choosing to invest earlier with less proof of success from the company) as it can highlight what qualities about a company indicates turning a huge profit for investments. These trends are not just useful to the investors, but also to startup founders as they can shape their path to fit patterns of success.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will be scraping the website https://www.failory.com/startups/mobile-apps-unicorns. This website holds data for unicorn companies in the mobile app world; as of 3/28/2022, there are 41 apps on the list. Because these companies have experienced such a high level of monetary success, they are good candidates for identifying success traits.\n",
